Project title:
==============
Image Classification using Deep Learing.

Project Description:
====================
A deep learning model  to classify an input image into one of the two categories ie, cut-off or complete

Project requirements:
=====================

1. Image dataset containing images of the top view of consumer products
2. A photo editor tool to generate positive images (ie, cut-off images)
3. A computer vision tool (eg.openCV) to extract only the required Region Of Interest from the Images.
4. Deep learning libraries such as keras and tensorflow.

Expected outcome:
=================
The model should recognize any input image as cut-off or complete
