Day 1 of learning FastAPI:
--------------------------
Official documentation:
https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/

Fast API is an lightweight web development framework of python which is used especially to design APIs.
-------

User Interfaces with fastAPI:
	1. Swagger UI
	2. Redoc
=========================================================================================================
Type hints:
----------

Type hints give us more precisioned results while using autocomplete.

Code example:

def get_full_name(first_name: str, last_name: str):
    full_name = first_name.title() + " " + last_name.title()
    return full_name


print(get_full_name("john", "doe"))

	1.So now as we already pass in the type hint the autocomplete gives us suggestions related to the data type specified.
	2.In addition to that you get error analyis on the go

Declaring type hints for iterables and other data types:
--------------------------------------------------------

There are some data structures that can contain other values, like dict, list, set and tuple. And the internal values can have their own type too.

To declare those types and the internal types, you can use the standard Python module typing.

from typing import List
def process_items(items: List[str]):
    for item in items:
        print(item)

Using optional type hints:
-------------------------

You can also use Optional to declare that a variable has a type, like str, but that it is "optional", which means that it could also be None.

from typing import Optional
def say_hi(name: Optional[str] = None):
    if name is not None:
        print(f"Hey {name}!")
    else:
        print("Hello World")

Note: u can also use classes as type hints(refer documentation)
